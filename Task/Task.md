# Task2 Making a Reliable UDP "Teams of two"
    - Make a server and receiver files
    - Each file has a starting number = 0 (which resembles the last packet number received)
    - The client should request the next packet by sending to the server the next number.
    - The server receives the request and then send the required packet.
    - When the client receives the packet it increments the number and the loop repeats.
